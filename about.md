 <p>Linguist and translator by academic background, I've recently developed a keen interest in a completely new kind of languages: those that favour camelCase over word spaces, indent much more than just paragraphs, and really do not tolerate any typos (that's okay, I've always been a hard-line proofreader).</p>
 <p>So far my coding adventure has felt a bit like entering the wizarding world where the wizards and witches of the tech community use words and numbers to form new spells and create wonderful, exciting things out of nothing. Finally after all those years, it seems like I might not be a Muggle after all.</p>
 <p>Currently I develop my digital and coding skills through attending regular <a href="https://codebar.io/" >Codebar</a> workshops, tech meetups and pursuing a range of courses covering both front-end and back-end development including:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>HTML & CSS,</li>
 <li>JavaScript and jQuery,</li>
 <li>using Git and GitHub for version control,</li>
 <li>SQL,</li>
 <li> Ruby.</li>
 </ul>
